This project analyzes NYC taxi data to determine the impact of payment type on fare amounts and explore ways to maximize driver revenue. Findings reveal that card payments are associated with higher average fares and longer trip distances compared to cash, with 67.5% of transactions completed by card. Hypothesis testing confirmed a statistically significant difference in fare amounts by payment type. Recommendations include incentivizing card payments, offering secure transaction options, and providing discounts to encourage customers to choose card payments, potentially boosting driver revenue.
